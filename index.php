			The purpose of this website is to help me develop and show my web design skills. I plan on incorporating 
			many technologies into this site including javascrit, ajax client and server validation, php, etc. The 
			content will be based on my	favorite sport, basketball, as well as other hobbies of mine. You can check
			out my code at https://github.com/HenryM88
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3>Done/To Do List:</h3>
			<p>Here is a list of what I've done so far and what I plan to do. Some ideas were thought of from the
			start and others came up as I was building the site. </p>
			<ul>
			<li>&#8730; relearn HTML, DOM, javascript, ajax, learn php mysql</li>
			<li>&#8730; basic menu, background</li>
			<li>&#8730; downloaded wamp server but was unable to how website publicly despite port forwarding</li>
			<li>&#8730; set up new database and members table in phpmyadmin </li>
			<li>&#8730; created suscribe page and used client side validation through ajax</li>
			<li>&#8730; used server-side validation onchange to check duplicate usernames in database</li>
			<li>&#8730; confirmed that suscribed peron's data entered into database</li>
			<li>&#8730; changed menu to be a php file to be included so that it can be easily changed</li>
			<li>&#8730; learned basic jquery and played with fadeIn, fadeOut animations</li>
			<li>&#8730; created a session</li>
			<li>&#8730; created login page, server side validation</li>
			<li>&#8730; tested and fixed suscribing and logging in issues successfully</li>
			<li>&#8730; encrypted password with md5 so the password that the user entered is not stored anywhere
					and cannot be retrieved, even by me.</li>
			<li>&#8730; started free webhosting on 000webhost.com</li>		
			<li>&#8730; adjusting changes to code and paths after moving to webhost, changed background image</li>
			<li>&#8730; installed adobe flash professional cs6, went through some tutorials, and made a cheesy chalk 
			powder toss .swf to fit with the background, then uploaded it to site</li>
			<li>&#8730; created 'my favorite shows' section in hobbies. Made a slideshow of my favorite shows, made
			a navigator for it, and it pauses on hover.</li>
			<br />
			<li>&#8730; did some html scraping in the players page. Took player information from espn.go.com and displayed it here. This was 
				done interactively through the drag and drop technique by the user. </li>
			<li>basic forum in progress:70-80% done</li>
			<li>lost password function</li>
			<li>about me page</li>
			<li>buttons to change site theme (css)</li>
			<li>audio, flash, animation</li>
			<li>install mac, linux on vmware and play around with it</li>
			<li>create timer since I started working on website using flash/actionscript</li>
			</ul>
